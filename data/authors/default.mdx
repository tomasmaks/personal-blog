    Hi there 👋👋👋
</h2>

I'm <strong>Tomas Maksimavičius</strong>, a tech founder and software engineer from <strong>Lithuania</strong>. 

I have a passion for programming, especially building web applications using <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>NextJS</strong>, <strong>NodeJS</strong>, and <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>. 

I love startups. I spend 10++ hours/week reading about startups from the best entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.

I enjoy building marketplaces, since networks are so powerful and hard to displace, even in such fast moving world.

In this blog, I want to share only very unique insights and knowledge I've gained from my reading list and also as a startup founder. 

Building, writing, and sharing helps me strengthen my understanding of new concepts and ideas.
